# qoi-bf

This repo contains brainfuck programs that implement the [Quite OK Image Format](https://qoiformat.org/). A brainfuck implementation with wrapping 8-bit cells is required.

- `fnl`: sources of the programs
- `bf`: generated brainfuck programs (ready to use)

## building the brainfuck programs
This step should only be necessary if you modify the source files in `fnl`.
```sh
make
```
